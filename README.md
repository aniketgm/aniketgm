- Helloüëã, I'm Aniket Meshram @aniketgm. (The title above is read as Enigme)
- I love üß° making scripts to easy things as much as possible. I hate doing repeated tasks (well who doesn't
  but the fact is people still do it. And they seldom do anything to make things simpler.
- I'm currently learning Pythonüêç. Coming from a C++ background, I really hate the concept of pointer, even
  though I have done lots of programming containing pointer. It's debatable.
- I'm also learning devops concepts so that I can help manage pipelines for organizations.
