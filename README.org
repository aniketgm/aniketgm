* About me
- Helloüëã Visitor, I'm Aniket Meshram.
- I'm currently living and working in India.
- I love üß° making scripts/apps to automate stuff, because I hate doing repetitive tasks.
- I love üß° listening to Music üé∂ and Podcasts üéôüéß and watch Anime (‡πë‚öà ‚Ä§Ã´ ‚öà‡πë).
- I listen to a bunch of Podcasts, like [[https://www.everyday-buddhism.com][Everyday-Buddhism]], [[https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510298/ted-radio-hour][Ted Radio Hour]], [[http://impacttheory.com][Impact-Theory]], [[https://www.jeffsanders.com/podcast/][5 AM Miracle]], [[https://www.theminimalists.com/podcast/][TheMinimalists]], and much more...
* What I do
- I was working as C++ Software Developer at HCL Tech.
- Although, I'm also currently learning [[https://www.python.org][Python]]üêç and it's Web frameworks - [[https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/][Flask]] and [[https://www.djangoproject.com][Django]].
- I'm also learning about building CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, Docker, Ansible and Kubernetes.
- I recently started using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]], although, at first I thought it was just a text editor. But after watching videos from [[https://www.youtube.com/c/SystemCrafters][SystemCrafters]], I got to know that it could do so much more, and Boy Oh Boy!, what a software. You can do tons of things in there, like managing tasks, using as an IDE, and even gaming!, and so apart from my office work I keep exploring Emacs a bit more.
